1) For 0-(n-1) based index
root : i
left child : 2*i+1
right child: 2*i+2
parent : i-1/2

2) For 1-n based index
root : i
left child: 2*i
right child: 2*i+1
parent: i/2


Time complexity

Insertion: O(1) // as index is already known
Search : O(n) // we have to traverse the whole array
Delete : O(n) // reason is same as above
